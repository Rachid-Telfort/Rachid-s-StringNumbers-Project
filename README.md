Rachid’s String Numbers Project README

About: This project was a personal project that I did which was inspired by this GeeksforGeeks article, http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multiply-large-numbers-represented-as-strings/, which explains how one can multiply large numbers represented as strings. I thought that was really cool how one can do that and I wondered if I could extend such a concept and add not only multiplication, but also division, mod, and other arithmetic methods. Thus, with that came String Numbers. If one is familiar with big integers and the like then String Numbers is basically the same concept. In addition, I undertook this project to get familiar with overloading other operators such as the postfix and prefix operators as well as to improve my C++ skills. Like my previous VectorGraph Project, there are only some examples and tests to show how one can use String Numbers. There is no menu program like my earlier programming projects.

Executable File Use: The executable file mainly shows some examples and tests to show how one can use String Numbers. The executable will run on an infinite loop so one can see the examples and tests, otherwise the executable would have quickly closed if the infinite while loop was not present.

Source Code Use: The source code associated with this project is free for anyone to use and possibly extend if they wish. If one has found any bugs or has any suggestions relating to the source code, please feel free to comment on the project page or e-mail me at rachidtelfort@gmail.com.

Final Notes: This project, in my opinion, is one of the cooler projects I’ve done and I learned a lot from it. I hope my fellow coders will learn as much as I did and find the source code helpful to fill their needs. If you have read this, thank you for visiting my GitHub page, it is much appreciated.
